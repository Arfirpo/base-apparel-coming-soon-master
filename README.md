  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- HTML5 forms
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- Regular Expressions (js)

### What I learned

This challenge served me mainly to learn how to validate forms with javascript.
In that sense, I had a first approach to the functioning of regular expressions, incorporating tools such as the "test" method, modifying styles of css from js, among other things.

### Continued development

In the future I would like to reinforce the concepts learned with this challenge and continue to expand my handling of both javascript and form creation in html and css.

### Useful resources

- [Regexr](https://regexr.com/) -This page provided me with a regular expression to validate the emails in my code.
